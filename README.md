# Group3BattleshipAI
 
Battleship AI created for final project in my C# class.

## Design Requirements

Complete the game including AI:

Implement the algorithm from Deliverable #1.
Document any errors you find in the algorithm that required changes by keeping your design document up to date.
Deliver a zipped folder with your group’s code as with Deliverable #2. Only submit one zip file for your entire group.
Your code should be able to play against the provided AIs and also will be challenged by the AIs from other groups as well as one from the instructor.

If your code takes an unreasonable amount of time or crashes, then your player will be removed from the game.
Since you have the starter code test harness you should be able to run many test passes yourself against the sample AIs.
Hopefully your AI player will win the game much (if not most) of the time.
Note: Any attempt to use reflection or any other similar techniques to determine other players’ positions will be considered cheating and will result in a grade of 0 for the assignment.
